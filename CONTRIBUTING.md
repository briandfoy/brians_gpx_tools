These are personal tools. If you have a change that is useful to me, I might support it. If it's not something I need, I likely won't add it unless it's extremely easy for me to merge.

I don't care about anything other than macOS. This is perl and should work other places and I generally program in a way that is portable, minimal, and self-contained, I might not do that.

If you like these tools, just take them and modify them to be whatever you need.
